# Roundlings
This is a project that has its origins with my friend,
[Andrei](https://andrei.website). I decided to make a tensorflow
version of his code and add a communication mechanism between
things: proteins.

This is kind of a tensorflow hello world for me in the sense
that I created this for practice. Therefore, don't expect much!
